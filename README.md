# Algorithm Engineering Lab WiSe 2020/21

This is a repository for the portfolio in the Algorithm Engineering Lab.
The goal of this university course is learning details of high performance computing by exploiting hardware properties.
Algorithm Engineering has a strong focus on C++, but I also sprinkled some Rust where feasible.

This repository is divided in three parts.

## Answers
The `answers` directory contains weekly assignments that peek into several topics from thread parallelism over vector intrinsics to interfacing with Python.
It is best viewed with a markdown renderer, e.g. on [GitHub](https://github.com/merkrafter/AlgorithmEngineeringLab2020).
Some weeks contain code snippets that investigate what effects certain techniques have on the performance.

## Project
The second part of this course is a more complex C++ project to put the pieces learned in the assignments together.
In my case, it is a bot library for a round-based, two-player board game.
Have a look at its README file for further information.

## Paper
The paper summarizes the knowledge gained during the project implementation.
It is a short, 4 pages overview that goes into the ideas used to solve the problem efficiently.
