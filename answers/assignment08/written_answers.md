# Explain the naming conventions for intrinsic functions

# What do the metrics latency and throughput tell you about the performance of an intrinsic function?

# How do modern processors realize instruction-level parallelism?

# How may loop unrolling affect the execution time of compiled code?

# What does a high IPC value mean in terms of the performance of an algorithm?
